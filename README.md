# Wurm Reloaded

Wurm Reloaded (WR) is an open source client for Wurm Unlimited (WU), built with the Godot engine with the purpose of having improved graphics, performance, stability and QOL.

To play with the WR client, you are required to own WU via Steam. There are two reasons for this.
1. To avoid breaching copyright laws, WR includes none of WU's assets. WR manages this by importing WU's models on initial setup.
1. WU servers require Steam authentication, this means that for the WR client to connect to them, the server you are trying to join will need the WR server mod. (TODO: Create WR server mod and link to it)
